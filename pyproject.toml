# RATIONALE for reportArgumentType = "warning":
# 15 type errors relate to:
# 1. Optional data in from_dict() deserializers (3 in decision.py)
#    - Dict.get() returns Optional, but fields are required
#    - Fix: Add runtime validation, not type ignores
# 2. List covariance in Trace.build() (3 in engine.py)  
#    - List[Subtype] not assignable to List[Union[...]]
#    - This is Python type system limitation, not a bug
# 3. Self type in recursive append() methods (2 in memory.py, trace.py)
#    - Pyright can't infer Self in complex inheritance
#    - Runtime behavior is correct
# 4. Dict key type mismatches in runtime.py (5 issues)
#    - Building dicts with mixed value types
#    - Intentional for Human IR output format
#
# These are tracked for future refinement but don't indicate bugs.

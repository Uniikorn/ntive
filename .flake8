# Flake8 Configuration - Formal Warning Ignores

# This file documents which flake8 warnings are intentionally ignored.

[flake8]
# Line length: 110 allows for type annotations without excessive wrapping
# 
# RATIONALE:
# - PEP 8's 79-char limit dates from punch-card era (1960s)
# - Modern displays easily handle 120+ characters
# - Complex type annotations (Union, Optional, generics) need horizontal space
# - 110 is a practical compromise: readable on most displays, 
#   accommodates modern Python typing without constant line breaks
#
# Lines exceeding 110 chars require inline `# noqa: E501` with justification
max-line-length = 110

# Ignored rules
# E302: "expected 2 blank lines" - conflicts with ruff isort formatting
#       Ruff's import organization is authoritative; E302 triggers false positives
#       when ruff separates stdlib/third-party/local imports with single blank lines
